Corezoid Task:
Quick Start - https://doc.corezoid.com/docs/quick-start

We need to create a process to determine if an actor/actress starring in a movie has won an Oscar (process can be created on https://admin.corezoid.com)

To do functionality:
1. Call GET https://imdb-api.com/{lang?}/API/SearchMovie/{apiKey}/{expression} to search a movie by title (we are interested only in the first movie)
2. Call GET https://imdb-api.com/{lang?}/API/Title/{apiKey}/{id} to get information about the movie, including stars (we are interested only in the first actor/actress)
3. GET https://imdb-api.com/{lang?}/API/NameAwards/{apiKey}/{id} to get information about the awards for the actor/actress

The outcome of the process should be End:Success if the actor/actress has won an Oscar, otherwise the outcome should be End:Error
